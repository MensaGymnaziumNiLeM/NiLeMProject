# NiLeMProject
Welcome to the Nikiforov's Learning Machine (NiLeM) Project!

## Explanation
What the NiLeM project is?
Primary goal of this project is to make learning (using electronics) much easier.

## NiLeM
It is the final result of the work.
Lessons show explanation of the topic and questions to the user. And the user can read and answer.
Anyone can help learners by adding something new to NiLeM.
NiLeM is the thing, that can be used by many, many, many users. For example, by You.
You don't need to understand programming, You just need to launch the NeLeM and it will take You to the world of learning.
The only question is: Is there enough of everything?
