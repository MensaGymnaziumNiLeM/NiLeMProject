English:
Welcome to NiLeM (Nikiforov's Learning Machine) project. This project is made to
make learning of anything (math, chemistry, physics, geography, history...) more
available. The main result is the NiLeM, but I have also made a NiLeSh, which
is used to make lessons in NiLeM really quickly. It makes it easy for everyone,
You do not need to understand HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Let me tell something about the NiLeM.
Who can use it?
    Anyone.
Why to use it?
    It is simple and there is a lot of possibilities waiting for You.
How to use it?
    1. Download the project (or just the NiLeM part). You can do it by clicking 
       on the button "Code" and then "Download zip".
    2. Open the Main.html file in Your browser. You can do it by right clicking
       on the file and choosing to open with browser.
    3. Here You are! Now navigate by intuitive buttons to any of subjects and
       choose any of the lessons.
    4. Enjoy and learn!

You may be interested in making something new. If You are, this part is for You.
So, now let me tell You something about NiLeSh.
Who can use it?
    People understanding computers (power users and programmers) and people
    following tutorials
Why to use it?
    Power users - teachers may find it useful, an other way to teach. And anyone
    else can use it for doing something good.
How to use it?
    Write a program and run it with the engine.
Where to write program?
    You can make the same program in file or in the console.
    If You write it to the file, write it to the text document.
    Write it to the text document.
    And again: WRITE IT TO THE TEXT DOCUMENT.
    70% of people do not understand, what does "text document" mean,
    so let me explain it. It is some file like this. There is only
    plain text, no fonts. It is opened by TextEditor, nano, vi, vim, edit,
    Notepad, or something like that.
    Text document IS NOT:
    JPEG image, PNG image, Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel,
    Microsoft Powerpoint, Open Document Text, Open Document Spreadsheet,
    Portable Document Format and other formats.
    NO, it is just plain text, it usually has .txt at the end.
    But if You can, You can use .nls or .nilesh, it is better for
    the program.
What is the syntax?
    The program starts with the line "subject//language".
    Look at the supported languages and subjects below.
    The 2nd line is the name of the file. It can be in a
    directory, just add it to the name like the path.
    If You have the same folder system like this, You can
    run the program from the NiLeMProject directory and it
    will change the NiLeM folder. Less time, more work made.
    You can also change the menu file, just enter "menu"
    at the name line. And then do not use commands for
    questions, use command "update".
    The 3rd line is always "{".
    Next lines will add some questions to Your quiz.
    See below the list of supported types of questions.
    Question lines must be written as "type//question//answer"
    or something like that. It depends on the type, but
    You always have to use the "//" to split it.
    End of the questions must be signed by "}" line.
    And then comes the "end" line.
    For more information look at the examples below.

    English (write lowercase: "english")

    Physics (write lowercase: "physics")
    Chemistry (write lowercase: "chemistry")
    Biology (write lowercase: "biology")
    Geography (write lowercase: "geography")

    Art (write lowercase: "art")
    Informatics (write lowercase: "informatics")
Supported types of questions (or other commands):
    enter:
        Gives the question and lets user write his answer.
        Must be used: "enter//question//correct answer"
    radio:
        Tells the question and lets user choose the correct answer.
        Must be used: "radio//question//answer0|answer1|answer2...//number of the correct answer (from 0)"
    explain:
        Can be used to tell the user some useful information.
        Includes no question. Can explain some theory. Can have unlimited number of lines.
        Must be used: "explain//info info info\ninfo info info\ninfo..."
    update:
        It is not a command for questions, use it for updating the menu.
        Use only when the name of file is set as "menu".
        Must be used without anything other: "update"
    run:
        It is not a command for questions, use it for running an other Nilesh script.
        Needs the path and the correct file extension.
        Must be used: "run//Path/To/TheFile.nls"
Examples:
Math-Basics-01-00.nls (it is used to make a 01-00-Adding.html file):

math//english
Basics/01-00-Adding
{
explain//Welcome to adding!\nIn this part You will learn to add.
explain//Imagine adding dots. Yes, dots.\nHere we have some dots:\n\n.....\n\nAnd here are some dots:\n\n...\n\nTry to count the first dots. 5 dots. And try to count the other ones. 3 dots.\nAnd now let's put them together!\n\n........\n\nAnd now let's count it!\n8 dots.\nCongrats, You have mastered simple adding!
explain//Let's master it a bit more!
enter//2+3//5
enter//1+1//2
radio//5+4//6|7|8|9|10//3
enter//7+1//8
radio//9+0//7|8|9|10|11//2
enter//5+2//7
}
end

MathMenu.nls (it is used to update the Math.html file):

math//english
menu
{
update
}
end
